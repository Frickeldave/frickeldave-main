## Git Quick Reference

### The Main Loop

Once you've made all the changes you want...

- Stage your changed files for commit: `git add .`
- Commit them, with a descriptive message: `git commit -m "message here"`
- Push the changes up to GitHub: `git push origin main`

### Other Useful Commands

If there's a change to any of your Node packages: `npm install`
If you mess things up real bad and just want to revert to the last commit: `git reset --hard`
When you want to pull changes down from GitHub: `git pull origin main`

### ðŸ§ž Commands (by Astro)
